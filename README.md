# Control playground

Small playground to check basic concepts of Control Theory in a visual manner. Available as a streamlit app in https://controlplayground-emty2vr685yang5qqdkb7l.streamlit.app/

For now, it has two tools:

- Interactive Laplace inverse transform

- Interactive PID feedback control for a FOPDT system
